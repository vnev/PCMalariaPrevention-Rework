## Peace Corps Malaria Prevention Android app

This is a rework of the Malaria Prevention app by the Peace Corps. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/peacecorps/malaria-app-android). This app contains a few improvements, including migration to Android Studio, adoption of Android's new design libraries, and more...

**All ownership of image assets and ideas belong to the Peace Corps and the developers behind the application. I am merely improving the application.**

Below is a screenshot of the current state of the application.
